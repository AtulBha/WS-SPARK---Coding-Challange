# 4a ii) Insights from Data
Looking at the overall activity, we see that highest engagement occurs between 1-1:59 a.m. and the biggest drop off occurs between 5-5:59 a.m.
Slicing the data further by cities, generally follows the same trend (as overall), although we have different minimum (7-7:59 a.m.) and maximum points (10-10:59 a.m.).
Although the data is fairly limited in its width (dimensions), we can derive some generally insights and set some long and short term strategies based on the Business goals.

Most of the activity comes from about top 3.35 % of cities and bottom 1% (243) of cities produce just 1 single activity. As such, we may want to create different business
strategies to maximize profit by either targeting the top heavy locations (provided there is a lot of opportunities for growth) or alternatively expand business 
goals/strategies to expand the marketing efforts in the bottom 1%.

Another strategy might be to maintain the top cities and focus on middle. However, this will require must more robust dataset to facilitate customer behaviour analysis 
and how they engage with the product (including brand loyalty).
